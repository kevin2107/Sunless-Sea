This is a small adventure game I am making based off Failbetter Stuido's game Sunless Sea.

A while back I played Sunless Sea with my brother and we both loved it. I was learning python at
the time and my brother came up with the idea to make a small spinoff port. I took him up and
began this as a side project. I'm still learning and have alot of work to do on this but
it's been fun so far.

I've recently added intergration of hue lights using phue to add some depth. If you have hue lights
make sure their around you! Right now it only works with the first 3 bulbs in your system.

I claim no intellectuall rights or anything related to Failbetter's Sunless Sea.
This is purely for fun.
